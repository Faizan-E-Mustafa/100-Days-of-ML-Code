# 100-Days-of-ML-Code
# Day 1:

Before i took this challenge i had completed 2 weeks of Andrew Ng's Convolutional Network course. I Watched week 3 videos , passed quiz and completed 30 percent of assignment. Week 3 Material is tough and interesting as compared to previous weeks material.

# Day 2:

I completed remaining assignment of week 3. Watched week 4 videos about face verification and recognition and did assignment.
Saimese Network and Triplet Loss are important concepts that i learned today.

# Day 3:

Watched week 4 videos about Neural Style Transfer(NSF), passed quiz and did half assignment.
I was amazed by adroitness of CNN at performing NSF task.Medium article explained NSF elegantly.

# Day 4:

Finished the course "Convolutional Neural Networks" by completing assignment of Week 4. I am yet not comfortable with frameworks (tensorflow, keras) . So will play more with these frameworks in the coming days.

# Day 5:

Started fifth course of specialization named "Sequence Models". Watched Week 1 videos about RNN, GRU and LSTM.Also Passed quiz and read Colah's Excellent Blog post about LSTM . Things are getting interesting now.

# Day 6:
Completed 2 assignments of week 1. Second assignment used RNN to give names to dinosaurs. I made and used small data set (150 entries)of Muslim names .Model produced impressive results.

# Day 7:

Completed assignment 3 of Week 1. I was amazed to know that deep learning can learn to compose music . I wonder what's coming next.

# Day 8: 

Watched week 2 videos and finished assignment 1. Embedding is an important concept in NLP. learnt about Word2Vec, negative sampling, GloVe word vector.

# Day 9 : 
Week 2 is now completed with the completion of assignment 2. used LSTM to emojify the sentence according to the sentiment of the sentence text. NLP is turning out to be an intriguing field.

# Day 10-12:
Watched videos about sequence to sequence architectures, beam search and Attention model. completed both assignmnets. I got the certificcate for Fifth course of awesome specialization.

# Day 13-16:
I wanted to work on a personel preject . i wanted to make "image captioning" project . SO i started Cs231n since andrej karpathy did a great job at explaining RNN's and Image captioning model. SO i watched Lecture 1-10 . i will do the remaining lectures but project is my proirity right now .

# Day 17-23:
I worked on Image captioning project. i have documented my whole experience in blog post . i have made a github repository for project.I have got decent results which are displayed below.links to  my work are also given below:
