# 100-Days-of-ML-Code
Day 1:

Before i took this challenge i had completed 2 weeks of Andrew Ng's Convolutional Network course. I Watched week 3 videos , passed quiz and completed 30 percent of assignment. Week 3 Material is tough and interesting as compared to previous weeks material.

Day 2:

I completed remaining assignment of week 3. Watched week 4 videos about face verification and recognition and did assignment.
Saimese Network and Triplet Loss are important concepts that i learned today.

Day 3:

Watched week 4 videos about Neural Style Transfer(NSF), passed quiz and did half assignment.
I was amazed by adroitness of CNN at performing NSF task.Medium article explained NSF elegantly.

Day 4:

Finished the course "Convolutional Neural Networks" by completing assignment of Week 4. I am yet not comfortable with frameworks (tensorflow, keras) . So will play more with these frameworks in the coming days.
